## The Odin Project's project to get the basics down. From using git and github to html and commit messages.

The project consists on familiarizing myself with the environment I've been setting up [^1]. From creating the basic *skeleton* of the HTML project to commiting changes to git and github, as well as geting used to VSCode[^2].
